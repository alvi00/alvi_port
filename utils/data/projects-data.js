      description: "This Project is basically for my academic purpose. Here I have made a Car buying Website and tried to make it quite similar to the Porsche Website. Here I have used java,JavaFX,CSS,JavaMail API for this project. Thanks a lot, This is pre- release or beta version. We are having some problems with fonts and car specs and some heap space-related issues with the runnable jar file. For the code, it runs pretty smooth, but a heap storage-related problem is there in the code. Feel free to contribute.",
